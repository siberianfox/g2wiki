g2core (and TinyG) are in use by people all over the world

This page links to the users we know about.  If your project, business, (etc) uses TinyG or g2core then please add yourself here.

Preferably with video (of TinyG/g2core in use), or even helpful instructions for others to do the same. :smile:

Also, if you know of other projects, people, businesses (etc) using TinyG/g2core who aren't listed here, please feel welcome to add them.

**Note that this page is very new, and is only just starting to have entries added**

## Videos

### Implementation

* [Katt Scott's ROSCon 2014 talk](https://vimeo.com/106993910#t=547s) about using ROS (Robot OS) to build a three axes pick and place robot
  * TinyG content starts around ~9:07.  Not super in depth on TinyG, mostly high level.

### Things being created, where g2core is part of the process

* [5 Axis - Custom Made Hotwire Cutter](https://vimeo.com/138558233)
  * Video showing the 5 Axis Hotwire cutter in action
* Golf putters by [Honu Putters](https://www.honuputters.com).  Reported [here](https://github.com/synthetos/g2/issues/296#issuecomment-381199892) by [@MitchBradley](https://github.com/MitchBradley) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoLG7eB8SuI
  * `In that video, the milling is done with Mach3 but since then I have built a new shop that is specialized for putters, converted my Taig mill to a g2core/Due/RaspberryPi/cncjs controller, and added several cnc processes to replace manual shaping.`
