# Motors Do Not Move
PROBLEM: The board seems fine, but the motors don't move. This is from https://github.com/synthetos/g2/issues/365[Issue #365]

The default settings disable axes for safety. Axes need to be enabled. In the x/y/z lines, it's showing those axis as disabled:

```
{"r":{"x":{"am":0,"vm":1000,"fr":1000,"tn":0,"tm":0,"jm":1000,"jh":1000,"hi":0,"hd":0,"sv":500,"lv":100,"lb":4,"zb":2}},"f":[1,0,1]}
{"r":{"y":{"am":0,"vm":1000,"fr":1000,"tn":0,"tm":0,"jm":1000,"jh":1000,"hi":0,"hd":0,"sv":500,"lv":100,"lb":4,"zb":2}},"f":[1,0,1]}
{"r":{"z":{"am":0,"vm":1000,"fr":1000,"tn":0,"tm":0,"jm":500,"jh":500,"hi":0,"hd":0,"sv":250,"lv":25,"lb":4,"zb":2}},"f":[1,0,1]}
```

Change "am" to enable the axis:

```
{"r":{"x":{"am":1,"vm":1000,"fr":1000,"tn":0,"tm":0,"jm":1000,"jh":1000,"hi":0,"hd":0,"sv":500,"lv":100,"lb":4,"zb":2}},"f":[1,0,1]}
```

There is ongoing discussion on how best to change the defaults.

# Arduino Due flash getting erased at random moments
PROBLEM: The flash on Chinese clones of Arduino Due is getting erased at seemingly random moments. This is from https://github.com/synthetos/g2/issues/235[Issue #235]

There was a hardware mistake in the older version of the Arduino Due (which happens to be the common version to be cloned in China) and luckily it is easy to fix by adding an SMD resistor to the PCB as explained http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=auto&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.civade.com%2Fpost%2F2016%2F12%2F18%2FCorriger-les-probl√®mes-de-Reset-sur-Arduino-DUE-R3-et-clones-chinois&sandbox=1[here].
