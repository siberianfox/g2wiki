_This page is for uploading an already compiled G2 binary to a target board without a debugger from Windows. Please see [Getting Started with g2core Development](Getting-Started-with-g2core-Development) for information about other options._

### Step 1 - Get the g2core.bin file

**Option 1** - Compile your own using the instruction in [Compiling the Code](Getting-Started-with-g2core-Development#compiling-the-code)

**Option 2** - Get the g2core.bin binary firmware files from https://github.com/synthetos/g2/releases
 * Click the "Assets" drop down for any of the releases.  The various g2core.bin files will be displayed, with names appropriate for specific boards we have configuration files for.

In either case you'll need to note the path to the resulting binary file. For example, if it's called `g2core.bin` and it's in the Downloads directory of your home page, you would use `%HOMEPATH%\Downloads\g2core.bin`. We'll call this `PATH_TO_BINARY` in the commands below.

### Step 2 - Download the `arduino-flash-tools`

The [arduino-flash-tools](https://github.com/facchinm/arduino-flash-tools/tree/master) repo contains the `bossac` utility. You can download the [zip file here](https://github.com/facchinm/arduino-flash-tools/archive/master.zip).

Expand the zip file in a location where you know the path, and note that path.

### Step 3 - Program g2core using `bossac.exe`

Hold down the Windows Key and press r then type cmd.exe and hit enter:

* `cd ` *path to expanded zip file contents* <br>
* `cd tools_windows\bossac\bin` <br>

Run the `mode` command by itself and it should return a `COM`x.  Note your port number for x to use as `COMx` in the following commands. Remember from above that `PATH_TO_BINARY` is to be replaced with the path to the downloaded or compiled `.bin` file.

After that go ahead and run these commands, replacing `COMx` with your port, like this: `COM4`.
* `mode COMx BAUD=1200`
* `bossac.exe --port=COMx -U false -e -w -v -b PATH_TO_BINARY -R`
